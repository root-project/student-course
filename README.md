This course targets young scientists and engineers with little or no experience
of ROOT. The aim of the course is to reach a solid understanding of the tools
available to conduct data analysis, processing and visualization.

The in-person course based on the material in this repository was recorded during the summer of 2025. The recording is available [here](https://videos.cern.ch/record/2301866). We encourage you to watch the video and follow along with the notebooks and exercises. 

Enjoy! And in case of any issues, don't hesitate to ask on our [forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch). 

## Note on ROOT version to be used

The course requires ROOT version 6.36 or higher to be followed.
