This course is part of the workshop on [Quasi-Interactive Analysis of Big Data
with High Throughput](https://agenda.infn.it/event/44199/), held in Bologna
(Italy) on January 8th 2025. It shows modern HEP data analysis approaches with
ROOT, with emphasis on the RDataFrame analysis interface. It mainly demonstrates
usage of the Pythonic API of ROOT and is fully based on Jupyter notebooks.

The `course/notebooks/01-basics` directory contains some basic concepts of ROOT
such as creating simple statistics and manipulating ROOT files. The
`course/notebooks/02-analysis` directory contains different examples of usage of
the RDataFrame interface and guides the participant through the main steps
required in a typical HEP analysis workflow. Relevant exercises can be found at
`course/notebooks/exercises/core`.

Enjoy! And in case of any issues, don't hesitate to ask on our
